# What is it ?

This is a compiler that works just like the compiler from chapter 2 of the dragon book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques,
and Tools. Authors: Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi and Jeffrey Ullman). It is written in Rust.
It gets input from file, arrays are not implemented, it has not `do` cycle.

# How to use it ?
Firstly you have to build it:

```bash
cargo build
```

And then run it:
```bash
cargo run examples/cycle.dbook
```
